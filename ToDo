The Timetracker isn't perfect yet.
There are some design flaws, general mistakes in the initialization and also just some cosmetic changes I would like to do:
A list includes:

General Flaws:
  1. window.categories is a js.object, which has no order. Therefore the categorys are in a random ordern when shown.
    -> Change the object to an array with all its fixes

Design Flaws:
  1. When applaying a time filter to entrys the same height of time filter and category filter gets messed up

  2. Entries table doesn't respond well to long descriptions, since it gous over boundary

  3. Passowrt Hide/Show is in the middle of the input field, not included for now

  4. Mobile version works, but very poorly. Login and Categories isn't well positioned, everythin is too small (charts, space for lists), 
     some filter buttons are too wide. but it should be usable for now


Design:
  1. Just generally go over everything and enhance it 


Done:
  GF:
    1. An entry which goes over 2 days is wrongfully displayed in the overveiw section.
    -> split such an entry in 2 or more entrys and then display it correctly
